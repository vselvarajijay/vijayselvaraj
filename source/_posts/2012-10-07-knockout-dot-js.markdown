Knockout is another JavaScript library to help Web Developers write desktop like web applications with more ease.  The library makes data binding easier for developers.  I only just started to work with it recently.  So far it seems to work very well, though the syntax takes a bit getting used to.  Also keep in mind that I am fairly new to ‘real’ JavaScript development.  I did find understanding MVVM helpful.  Getting used to the syntactical sugar will just take some time.

Some links I found to be helpful:
