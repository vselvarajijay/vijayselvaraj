I am still trying to figure out what the heck I have this site for.  No luck yet figuring out what my future posts will be about, but I do know it will likely be related to software engineering.  I love visuals, and I know there will be times the best way for me to express what I know is through visuals, so I went surfing for a UML modeling tool and came across yUML which is in beta.

http://www.yuml.me


Have a look, Iâ€™ll very likely be using this tool to post UML models on this site.
