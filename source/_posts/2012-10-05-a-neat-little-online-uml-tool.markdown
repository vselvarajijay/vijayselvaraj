I am still trying to figure out what the heck I have this site for.  No luck yet.  However I do know that it would likely be related to software engineering.  I love visuals, and I know there will be times the best way for me to express what I know is through visuals.  After some surfing for a UML modeling tool, I came across yUML which is in beta.

http://www.yuml.me


Have a look, Iâ€™ll be using this tool to post UML models on this site.
